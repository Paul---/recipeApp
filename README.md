# Food 4 Fun Recipe App <The third-party api used for this app has sadly been shut down>

An intuitive application that will help you discover delicious, fun recipes from around the world from the comfort of a computer or smartphone.

## Motivation

I wanted to create an application that would introduce users around the world to great, world-famous recipes from around the globe.


## Screenshots

As your application loads, the program prepares you for the tasty goodness that is coming to your screen...

The application then loads a list of suggested recipes and invites you to try a search of your own.

You can search by ingredient, ethnicity or even popular dish names. The app then goes to work finding great recipe suggestions that fit your search.

Like magic, recipes that fit your criteria are displayed for your culinary pleasure. It even allows you to print your ingredients page or find the detailed cooking instructions from the recipe owner's site (a new window is launched for the cooking directions).
